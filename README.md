# library

# back-end

Before running this, you will need an .env file to connect to a database.  Get it from someone if you don't have it already.

Go to /library/back-end in a terminal (such as bash, powershell may not work)

run `npm i` to install the node packages needed to run the back end.

run `npx prisma generate` to create the files for Prisma, which is an ORM.

 and type `npm start` and the server will run on localhost:3000.  Let me know if you need to change this.

# front-end-1

Go to /library/front-end-1 in a terminal (such as bash, powershell may not work)

run `npm i` to install the node packages needed to run the front end.

type `npm run dev` to get the server going on localhost:5173.  Let me know if you need to change the url.
